### Install Ruby on Rails On Ubuntu 23.04

#### Installation Stack
  - Rbenv
  - Ruby (latest)
  - Ruby on Rails (Latest)
  - Nodejs (Latest Stable)
  - Yarn Package Manager (Latest)
  - Git

In this tutorial we are going to use rbenv to install and ruby and ruby on raills.

### Lest begin.

### Step -1 (Updat Ubuntu)
---
At first lets update ubutu.

```jsx
sudo apt update
```

### Step - 2 (Install CURL if not installed)


```jsx
sudo apt install curl
```

Step -3 (Install Required Dependencies)
---
Now install require dependencies.

```jsx
sudo apt install git curl libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev autoconf bison build-essential libyaml-dev libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev
```

### Step - 4 (Install Rbenv)

```jsx
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
```

### Step - 5 (Add Path To Bash)

Now we need to add the rbenv path to bash.

```jsx
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
```jsx
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```jsx
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### If you are using zsh then change `bashrc to zshrc` like as follows

```jsx
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
```jsx
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
```jsx
source ~/.zshrc
```


### Step - 5 (Install Ruby)

Lets check the version on Ruby.

```jsx
rbenv install -l
```
This will give us the available ruby version that we can install in our machine. The output will be something like as follows.

```jsx
2.7.7
3.0.5
3.1.3
3.2.1
jruby-9.4.1.0
mruby-3.2.0
picoruby-3.0.0
truffleruby-22.3.1
truffleruby+graalvm-22.3.1

Only latest stable releases for each Ruby implementation are shown.
Use 'rbenv install --list-all / -L' to show all local versions.
```

Now lets pick up the latest version that is `3.2.1` as we can see from the list.

```jsx
rbenv install 3.2.1
```
This is going to take some times, so don't worried.

After completion of installation, lets make ruby global.

```jsx
rbenv global 3.2.1
```

Now lets check the installed ruby version in our machine. if everything goes well, we will get the version name.

```jsx
ruby -v
```

The output will be something like as follows. 
```jsx
ruby 3.1.2p20 (2022-04-12 revision 4491bb740a) [x86_64-linux]
```



### Step - 6 (Install Bundler)

Ruby on rails use bundler to manage gem dependencies. so we need to install bundler.

```jsx
gem install bundler
```
