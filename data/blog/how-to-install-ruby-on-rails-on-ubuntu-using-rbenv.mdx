### Install Ruby on Rails On Ubuntu 23.04

#### Installation Stack
  - Rbenv
  - Ruby (latest)
  - Ruby on Rails (Latest)
  - Nodejs (Latest Stable)
  - Yarn Package Manager (Latest)
  - Git

In this tutorial we are going to use rbenv to install and ruby and ruby on raills.


### Let's Start üöÄ
The first step is to install some dependencies for Ruby and Rails.
To make sure we have everything necessary to support Rails, we're first going to start by adding the Node.js and Yarn repositories to our system before installing them.



### Step -1 (Updat Ubuntu)
---
At first lets update ubuntu.

```jsx
sudo apt update
```

### Step - 2 (Install CURL if not installed)
---
```jsx
sudo apt install curl
```

### Step - 3 (Install Nodejs if not installed)
```jsx
sudo apt install nodejs
```

### Step - 4 (Add Yarn Package Manager)

```jsx
npm install --global yarn
```

Step - 5 (Install Required Dependencies)
---
Now install require dependencies.

```jsx
sudo apt install git curl libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev autoconf bison build-essential libyaml-dev libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev
```

### Step - 6 (Install Rbenv)

```jsx
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
```

### Step - 7 (Add Path To Bash)

Now we need to add the rbenv path to bash.

```jsx
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
```jsx
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```jsx
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### If you are using zsh then change `bashrc to zshrc` like as follows

```jsx
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
```jsx
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
```jsx
source ~/.zshrc
```


### Step - 8 (Install Ruby)

Lets check the version on Ruby.

```jsx
rbenv install -l
```
This will give us the available ruby version that we can install in our machine. The output will be something like as follows.

```jsx
2.7.7
3.0.5
3.1.3
3.2.1
jruby-9.4.1.0
mruby-3.2.0
picoruby-3.0.0
truffleruby-22.3.1
truffleruby+graalvm-22.3.1

Only latest stable releases for each Ruby implementation are shown.
Use 'rbenv install --list-all / -L' to show all local versions.
```

Now lets pick up the latest version that is `3.2.1` as we can see from the list.

```jsx
rbenv install 3.2.1
```
This is going to take some times, so don't worried.

After completion of installation, lets make ruby global.

```jsx
rbenv global 3.2.1
```

Now lets check the installed ruby version in our machine. if everything goes well, we will get the version name.

```jsx
ruby -v
```

The output will be something like as follows. 
```jsx
ruby 3.1.2p20 (2022-04-12 revision 4491bb740a) [x86_64-linux]
```

Now run the following command to work rbenv work properly.

```jsx
rbenv rehash
```


### Step - 9 (Install Bundler)

Ruby on rails use bundler to manage gem dependencies. so we need to install bundler.

```jsx
gem install bundler
```



### Step - 10 (Install Rails)
If everything goes in a correct way, we can install rails now.

```jsx
gem install rails -v 7.0.5
```
or if you want you can istall the latest version with out any specific version.

```jsx
gem install rails
```

The output will be as follows

```jsx
Successfully installed rails-7.0.5
35 gems installed
```

we can check the installed rails version with the following command.

```jsx
rails -v
```

The output will be as follows.

`Rails 7.0.5`


Now run the following command to work rbenv work properly.

```jsx
rbenv rehash
```


### Step - 11 (Configuring Git)
Now we are going to configure our github account.
Replace `my name` and `email address` in the following steps with the ones you used for your Github account.'

```jsx
git config --global color.ui true
```
```jsx
git config --global user.name "my name"
```
```jsx
git config --global user.email "myname@email.com"
```
```jsx
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "myname@email.com"
```

The next step is to take the newly generated SSH key and add it to your Github account.

```jsx
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Now we have to copy and paste the output and paste it to github settings. "
The output will look like this.

```jsx
ssh-rsa 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 myname@email.com
```

Now let's check and see if it worked. Type the following command in the terminal.

```jsx
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You will get a message like this:
```jsx
Hi excid3! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

### Step - 12 (Setting Up A Database)

Rails ships with sqlite3 as the default database. Chances are you won't want to use it because it's stored as a simple file on disk. You'll probably want something more robust like MySQL or PostgreSQL. There are lots of documentation on both, so just pick one that seems like you'll be more comfortable with.
If you're new to Ruby on Rails or databases in general, I strongly recommend setting up PostgreSQL. If you're coming from PHP, you may already be familiar with MySQL.

#### Install and Setup PostgreSQL latest version
Run the following command to install Postgres and dependencies:

```jsx
sudo apt install postgresql libpq-dev
```
after completion of postgres installation we have to follow the next step.
As postgres installation doesn't setup a user for you, so you'll need to follow these steps to create a user with permission to create databases. Feel free to replace myname with your username.

```jsx
sudo -u postgres createuser myname -s
```

If you would like to set a password for the user, you can do the following. this will open postgres in terminal.
```jsx
sudo -u postgres psql
```

now change the password by replace `\password` with your own password
```jsx
postgres=# \password myname
```

#### All Setup Done, lets create a new rails application now üòäüòäüòä.


### Create New Rails App



##### If you want to use SQLite (not recommended) run this command.
```jsx
rails new myapp
```

#### If you want to use MySQL run this command.
```jsx
rails new myapp -d mysql
```

#### If you want to use Postgres run this command.
##### Note that this will expect a postgres user with the same username as your app, you may need to edit config/database.yml to match the user you created earlier
```jsx
rails new myapp -d postgresql
```

### Move into the application directory
```jsx
cd myapp
```

#### If you setup MySQL or Postgres with a username/password, modify the
#### config/database.yml file to contain the username/password that you specified

### Create the database
rake db:create

Run the server.
```jsx
rails server
```

Hurray, Successfully Installed Rails and create your first ruby on rails app successfully! üî•üî•üî• üêßüêßüêß
