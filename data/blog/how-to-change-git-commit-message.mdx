There are times when we need to change the git commit message, some times, after push and some times before push. This is happen when we make a typo in the message or want to remove some info from the message. We can change those commit message in different way depending upon the situation. Leyt's Move on.


## Change the most recent / Last commit
To make change in the last or most recent commit run the following command in the terminal.

```jsx
git commit --amend
```

with this command the message file will open. and on the top of the file you will be able to see the message. just make the change according to your need.
afte make the change save the file. 
 > (if the file open in `nano` press `CTRL + X` and enter to save the change.)

## single command approach
We can also use the single command approach to change the most recent / last git commit.

```jsx
git commit -amend -m "Your message"
```

write this command and within the quote add your new message. This will replace the old message with the new one.
